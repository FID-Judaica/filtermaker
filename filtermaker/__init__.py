"""Provides a namespace for building a building filtering suits based on
characteristics of strings.

At the top level, it provides one function, `get_filterspace()`, which returns
an instance of the namespace defined in the _filterspace module.

Basically, it gives you a bunch of decorators and convinience fucntions for
registering a bunch of tests and then you get a Filter class for quickly
running those tests against a string.
